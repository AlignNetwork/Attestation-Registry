<h4>Creator/Attestor: Align Network</h4>

This Attestation signifies a generic statement post on Align. It allows users or bots to make a statement regarding any topic and provide proof to back up their claims. The generic statement must follow the rules and disputes must be handled according to the resolution section. Most attestations will default to this attestation type, and a dispute corollary could be drawn to X(formerly twitter) [Community Notes](https://communitynotes.x.com/guide/en/about/introduction).

Psudeocode:

```
{
  "Attester": "Align Network",
  "Claim": "Bitcoin is bad for the environment",
  "Claim Proof": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-018-0321-8"
}
```

### Claim Rules

The claim can be very generic and broad. Anything goes: "I like cats" to "Bitcoin mining is bad"

### Resolution Stage 1

If a dispute is made, verified by a human and AI council, a log will be placed under the attestation outlining the dispute similarly to [Community Notes](https://communitynotes.x.com/guide/en/about/introduction) on X(formerly Twitter). The log will be public allowing anyone to read and understand the exchange. Reputation will not be calculated during this stage allowing Align to slowly roll out the reputation network as to not overburden the network at the onset and to learn from use of the network.

### Dispute Example

The claim above, is demonstrably false, as heavily defended by Nic Carter on many occasions [medium article example](https://medium.com/@nic__carter/comments-on-the-white-house-report-on-the-climate-implications-of-crypto-mining-8d65d30ec942). Someone can bring this proof up against the attestation and in Stage 1, it will be shown under the post in the Wondernet App.
